## Requirements

### Data Files (Optional)
- `mac_vendors.json` - MAC address to vendor mapping
- `manufacturer_ids.json` - BLE manufacturer ID database
- `service_uuids.json` - BLE service UUID definitions

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CyberNilsen/CyberBLE
cd CyberBLE
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python CyberBLE.py
```

## Usage

### Basic Scanning
1. **Quick Scan (Offline)** - Uses local databases for fast device identification
2. **Deep Scan (Online)** - Performs online vendor lookups for enhanced accuracy
3. **Continuous Scan** - Monitors devices in real-time with automatic updates

### Features
- **Double-click** any device in the list to view detailed information
- **Click column headers** to get explanations of each data field
- **Enhance Vendors** button performs online lookups for unknown vendors
- **Export Results** saves all discovered devices to a timestamped JSON file
- **Clear Results** removes all devices from the current view

### Device Information Displayed
- **MAC Address** - Hardware identifier
- **Name** - Device name or detected identifier
- **Type** - Classified device category
- **Vendor** - Manufacturer based on MAC lookup
- **Manufacturer ID** - BLE advertisement manufacturer data
- **Services** - Available BLE services
- **RSSI** - Signal strength indicator
- **Last Seen** - Time of last detection

## Device Types Detected

The tool automatically classifies devices into categories:
- Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, AirPods, etc.)
- Samsung devices (Galaxy series, etc.)
- Fitness trackers (Fitbit, Garmin, etc.)
- Audio devices (Beats, JBL, Sony, Bose, etc.)
- Gaming devices (Nintendo, Xbox, etc.)
- Smart home devices (Google, Tesla, etc.)
- Input devices (keyboards, mice, etc.)

## Data Files Format

### mac_vendors.json
```json
{
  "001122": "Apple, Inc.",
  "AABBCC": "Samsung Electronics Co.,Ltd"
}
```

### manufacturer_ids.json
```json
{
  "004C": "Apple, Inc.",
  "0075": "Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd."
}
```

### service_uuids.json
```json
{
  "180d": "Heart Rate",
  "180f": "Battery Service"
}
```

## Export Format

Results are exported as JSON with the following structure:
```json
{
  "scan_info": {
    "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00",
    "device_count": 5,
    "tool": "CyberBLE Pro"
  },
  "devices": [
    {
      "mac": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
      "name": "iPhone",
      "type": "Apple",
      "vendor": "Apple, Inc.",
      "manufacturer_id": "0x004C (Apple, Inc.)",
      "services": "Generic Access (1800)",
      "rssi": "-45",
      "last_seen": "10:30:15"
    }
  ]
}
```

## System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python**: 3.7 or higher
- **Bluetooth**: BLE-capable Bluetooth adapter
- **Permissions**: May require administrator/root privileges on some systems

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **No devices found**: Check if Bluetooth is enabled and BLE adapter is working
- **Permission errors**: Run as administrator/root if required
- **Slow scanning**: Move closer to target devices or check for interference
- **Online lookup fails**: Check internet connection

### Platform-Specific Notes
- **Linux**: May need to run with `sudo` for BLE access
- **Windows**: Ensure Windows 10 version 1903 or later for best BLE support
- **macOS**: Grant Bluetooth permissions when prompted
